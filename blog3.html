    <p>
      In our busy lives, self-care is often neglected, but it is one of the most 
      important habits for a healthy lifestyle. Self-care doesn’t mean luxury 
      or selfishness—it simply means taking time to care for your physical, 
      emotional, and mental well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple habits like regular exercise, eating healthy, reading, meditation, 
      and maintaining good sleep can significantly improve your overall health. 
      It also includes saying no to unnecessary stress, creating boundaries, 
      and taking breaks when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you prioritize self-care, you recharge your energy and become 
      better prepared to handle challenges. Remember: you can only give your 
      best to others when you are at your best yourself.
